# EAS Build ignore file
# This file tells EAS Build which files to exclude from the build

# Dependencies are installed by EAS, but we want to include lockfile
# So we don't ignore package-lock.json

# Ignore these:
node_modules/
.expo/
.expo-shared/
*.log
.DS_Store

# Keep package-lock.json for consistent builds
